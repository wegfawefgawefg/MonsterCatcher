    Guidelines for attributes for each of the 3 levels of definitions.
    Some attributes are mandatory at specific levels.
    Some attributes are cascading, in that if they are not defined at the current level, 
        they must be defined at some level above atleast.
    Some attributes are totally optional.

    These are never used for game logic ever. 
    They are just for locating things within the json, or for human reference.

    Names are only used at the game level or map level. 
    If you name an inline definition for a tile or npc at the leaf level, it can never be referenced, so 
    it will never be used.

no names and types of the same string at the same level
